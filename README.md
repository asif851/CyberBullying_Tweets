# CyberBullying_Tweets
Introduced a model that detects whether the tweet is bullying or not and if bullying then what type of bullying it is. For this, I have built several machine learning models like Naive Bayes, passive aggressive and SVM. I used the SVM model in the deployment of the project. Finally, I used flask framework to deploy this project.
